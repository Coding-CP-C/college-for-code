4. VHDL Code Writing
5. Compile and Run program.

Theory:
Half adders are a basic building block for new digital designers. A half-adder shows how two bits can be added together with a few simple logic gates. A single full-adder has two one-bit inputs, a carry-in input, a sum output, and a carry-out output.

Full Adder is the adder which adds three inputs and produces two outputs. The first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C-IN. The output carry is designated as C-OUT and the normal output is designated as S which is SUM.

ALGORITHM:
1. Define Library functions.
2. Declare Entity and Architecture.
3. Describe functionality.
4. End source code.
5. Compile and Run program.

DESRIPTION:
For adding together larger numbers a Full-Adder can be used. A single half-adder has two one-bit inputs, a sum output, and a carry-out output.

Refer to the truth table below to see how these bits operate. The code creates a half adder. There is also a test bench that stimulates the design and ensures that it behaves correctly.
